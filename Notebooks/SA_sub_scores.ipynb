have insurance and i are planning so fine i'm trying to understand what's on.\\nI don't know why we're not receiving your form because we did receive your other your when you and your um selection for uninsured under insured are.\\nEmailing it ah forms f. o. r. m. s. at safe auto dot com.\\nIncluding your policy number did you say he was just.\\nThe ones that you find when you originally started the uninsured under insured motorist bodily injury.\\nOkay i think that's because they sent me a but um and i just signed it that way well yeah i email to several times almost going on or policy

same email it's forums f. o. r. m. assets.\\nIts auto dot com yeah f. o. r. m._s. mhm yeah see.\\nDot e. and c o dot com yeah i sent it i'm going to resent that now.\\nThe other issue is is that the department of motor vehicles which is probably why you're having that issue they're telling us they can't find your driving record with the information that we have um whats your data birth have your sixteenth nineteen eighty nine and what.\\nFull social two four eight seven seven eight five zero three thats what we got could you verify your drivers licence number.\\nUm hold on one second i'm good thank you.\\nAnd are you guys spending it because cause the calls and reading credit.\\nIm right but they're not we're not able to when we send your information to the state to get your driving history they're telling us and they can't find your driving history they can't find your information with the information that we have not typically that means that maybe something's wrong i fly but.\\nChecking your drivers license social and date of birth to see if any of that would be incorrect um well thank you.\\nDrivers license number is zero six zero three zero one six three.\\nNope thats what we've got and you do in your drivers license number correct.\\nYeah and my name is john need so mon sending type in kennedy that make a difference.\\nThat could if it's not the exact name of listed on your drivers license okay so oh yeah so we got your we've got sure any whats the second part of that first name um.\\nJourney was the first name the mall s a m o n e as my middle name and then ten minutes at that im im awareness heightening kennedy k e n n e think why is my last name.\\nYour data on even touched on that simon's i can see.\\nNo just enough time going to order new motor vehicle report under that information and see if we can get it back that takes about forty eight hours for a story straight that report back.\\nOkay so they never bear are insurance to go up against.\\nNo i'm we need to get the information bucket of should actually probably help your insurance if we can verify your driving record.\\nUnless on the off chance you were to have you know multiple accidents or something like that come back on but if not.\\nSaid help iraq you shouldn't help your insurance in the end.\\nOkay yeah 'cause i suppose in before and wasn't none of them were my fault but the guy said he pulled them all before 'cause we went over.\\nWhen we first got the policy that might have been from your previous.\\nFor the only thing we've got the not at fault but we haven't actually seen your motor vehicle report because we haven't the state haven't returned it to us at the information um draw particular show it could be your name.\\nSo hopefully that's the that's the issue um bears me just a second how you get that ordered.\\nUh-huh okay got that ordered can then let me get the tape to the policy.\\nYou're going to get new cards in the mail um in about three to five days cause its been how they turn him one okay.\\nHow long have you is it anyway planted a pay what was the baby.\\n'cause i just drink that again truckers and just.\\nEnough can sometimes unfortunately checked about ten to fifteen minutes to process through system for not sure if i'll be able to fear right away.\\nLet me see anything kept count.\\nYeah were about eighteen minutes behind the lived email us at ten o'clock.\\nIt takes about usually about fifteen minutes or so they'll in but before the system updates defeat haven't you said you put your policy number on it um.\\nMany and make sure i it's the policy number on that that'd be the issue.\\nMhm one on one since.\\nIs that he had the policy number one you guys wouldn't have been able to match it right right and like like when you're going to foreign we have our policy number automatically on it with those documentary makes it hard to match them then disney 'cause need the insurance agency.\\nNo i just had our name on it so i'm gonna send that again um hold on one sec yeah do you have your policy number yeah i'm going to get it from you give me just one second year.\\nOkay um.\\nFor me its g in charge i guess an apple seven three three eight four seven.\\nI see a seventh recreate balls than that.\\nOkay and then i have on your own it can it a started days in a daze mortgage payment.\\nOkay thats fine yeah and then i had that.\\nNot see it but the subject perfect.\\nSo hopefully it works for the time now well they'd be able to take off.\\nThat because i like to have any sending it but i maybe it's because i didn't.\\nThe policy number and your i don't know um.\\nMedical to take off like with that just come back on when when they were not responsible for the thousand dollars and.\\nYeah we'll be able to apply to discount back that's on problem wants to get the proof on there now as far as the billing you you had a couple of things going on one was the homeowners discount.\\nThe biggest partially portion of it now is uh looks like you added a vehicle i'm also in that carried over.\\nUm let's see so right now you have eight seventies or eight seven eight seventy eight do.\\nUm we've ordered your motor vehicle report hopefully that'll help with that once i get that back like i said about forty eight hours on that and then we'll get that documentary in and get it applied also on to see if that won't reduce your rate.\\nOkay now as far as the vehicle that edit on cause i.\\nT like okay i can we originally pay we pay whatever i think go to some and then they said it was gonna go.\\nTo five something an ad in the second vehicle right right and so i gained at least seventy or whatever that.\\nNot was that was an ad in the new vehicle on the kid had been like a french bill from you just you know just both vehicles correct.\\nLets say scott bacteria billing there's been a lot of changes nights.\\nRight but then you also had the unfortunately are your license didn't come back which.\\nAn increase and then the new ah your homeowners discount so um we got the motor vehicle report ordered and your name updated so hopefully that'll.\\nThat issue and then as soon as we can get that um hopefully we get your bill address to town.\\nThree and then i received a medicine at the policy the terminate but as long as i paid it before then nineteenth i should be fine right.\\nRight you you the last day to make that payment to be the nineteenth before midnight eastern standard.\\nOkay okay.\\nThey make so much and what was your name a money thing.\\nApril through so much for your help i really appreciate it.\\nHow much there anything else i can help you in.\\nUm no i guess i'll just call back in the morning to make sure that you

notices from the d._n._a. game.\\nI don't have insurance and i are planning so fine i'm trying to understand what's on.\\nI don't know why we're not receiving your form because we did receive your other your when you and your um selection for uninsured under insured are.\\nEmailing it ah forms f. o. r. m. s. at safe auto dot com.\\nIncluding your policy number did you say he was just.\\nThe

that now.\\nThe other issue is is that the department of motor vehicles which is probably why you're having that issue they're telling us they can't find your driving record with the information that we have um whats your data birth have your sixteenth nineteen eighty nine and what.\\nFull social two four eight seven seven eight five zero three thats what we got could you verify your drivers licence number.\\nUm hold on one second i'm good thank you.\\nAnd are you guys spending it because cause the calls and reading credit.\\nIm right but they're not we're not able to when we send your information to the state to get your driving history they're telling us and they can't find your driving history they can't find your information with the information that we have not typically that means that maybe something's wrong i fly but.\\nChecking your drivers license social and date of birth to see if any of that would be incorrect um well thank you.\\nDrivers license number is zero six zero three zero one six three.\\nNope thats what we've got and you do in your drivers license number correct.\\nYeah and my name is john need so mon sending type in kennedy that make a difference.\\nThat could if it's not the exact name of listed on your drivers license okay so oh yeah so we got your we've got sure any whats the second part of that first name um.\\nJourney was the first name the mall s a m o n e as my middle name and then ten minutes at that im im awareness heightening kennedy k e n n e think why is my last name.\\nYour data on even touched on that simon's i can see.\\nNo just enough time going to order new motor vehicle report under that information and see if we can get it back that takes about forty eight hours for a story straight that report back.\\nOkay so they never bear are insurance to go up against.\\nNo i'm we need to get the information bucket of should actually probably help your insurance if we can verify your driving record.\\nUnless on the off chance you were to have you know multiple accidents or something like that come back on but if not.\\nSaid help iraq you shouldn't help your insurance in the end.\\nOkay yeah 'cause i suppose in before and wasn't none of them were my fault but the guy said he pulled them all before 'cause we went over.\\nWhen we first got the policy that might have been from your previous.\\nFor the only thing we've got the not at fault but we haven't actually seen your motor vehicle report because we haven't the state haven't returned it to us at the information um draw particular show it could be your name.\\nSo hopefully that's the that's the issue um bears me just a second how you get that ordered.\\nUh-huh okay got that ordered can then let me get the tape to the policy.\\nYou're going to get new cards in the mail um in about three to five days cause its been how they turn him one okay.\\nHow long have you is it anyway planted a pay what was the baby.\\n'cause i just drink that again truckers and just.\\nEnough can sometimes unfortunately checked about ten to fifteen minutes to process through system for not sure if i'll be able to fear right away.\\nLet me see anything kept count.\\nYeah were about eighteen minutes behind the lived email us at ten o'clock.\\nIt takes about usually about fifteen minutes or so they'll in but before the system updates defeat haven't you said you put your policy number on it um.\\nMany and make sure i it's the policy number on that that'd be the issue.\\nMhm one on one since.\\nIs that he had the policy number one you guys wouldn't have been able to match it right right and like like when you're going to foreign we have our policy number automatically on it with those documentary makes it hard to match them then disney 'cause need the insurance agency.\\nNo i just had our name on it so i'm gonna send that again um hold on one sec yeah do you have your policy number yeah i'm going to get it from you give me just one second year.\\nOkay um.\\nFor me its g in charge i guess an apple seven three three eight four seven.\\nI see a seventh recreate balls than that.\\nOkay and then i have on your own it can it a started days in a daze mortgage payment.\\nOkay thats fine yeah and then i had that.\\nNot see it but the subject perfect.\\nSo hopefully it works for the time now well they'd be able to take off.\\nThat because i like to have any sending it but i maybe it's because i didn't.\\nThe policy number and your i don't know um.\\nMedical to take off like with that just come back on when when they were not responsible for the thousand dollars and.\\nYeah we'll be able to apply to discount back that's on problem wants to get the proof on there now as far as the billing you you had a couple of things going on one was the homeowners discount.\\nThe biggest partially portion of it now is uh looks like you added a vehicle i'm also in that carried over.\\nUm let's see so right now you have eight seventies or eight seven eight seventy eight do.\\nUm we've ordered your motor vehicle report hopefully that'll help with that once i get that back like i said about forty eight hours on that and then we'll get that documentary in and get it applied also on to see if that won't reduce your rate.\\nOkay now as far as the vehicle that edit on cause i.\\nT like okay i can we originally pay we pay whatever i think go to some and then they said it was gonna go.\\nTo five something an ad in the second vehicle right right and so i gained at least seventy or whatever that.\\nNot was that was an ad in the new vehicle on the kid had been like a french bill from you just you know just both vehicles correct.\\nLets say scott bacteria billing there's been a lot of changes nights.\\nRight but then you also had the unfortunately are your license didn't come back which.\\nAn increase and then the new ah your homeowners discount so um we got the motor vehicle report ordered and your name updated so hopefully that'll.\\nThat issue and then as soon as we can get that um hopefully we get your bill address to town.\\nThree and then i received a medicine at the policy the terminate but as long as i paid it before then nineteenth i should be fine right.\\nRight you you the last day to make that payment to be the nineteenth before midnight eastern standard.\\nOkay okay.\\nThey make so much and what was your name a money thing.\\nApril through so much for your help i really appreciate it.\\nHow much there anything else i can help you in.\\nUm no i guess i'll just call back in the morning to make sure that you guys just need to emails yeah i'll keep a look at it for tonight i'm here tonight so i'll keep an eye out of hopefully it'll come through soon but are into writing department of

we don't have a record of it the last time and you made was on the twenty ninth of january.\\nYeah but i paid my i paid every month because i don't get the money until the third of the month to pay.\\nCause i had to talk to them to other people.\\nInteresting well i mean we got to hearing from you january fifth and then another payment january the twenty ninth.\\nThe twenty ninth which was about thirteen days they're fourteen days ago we haven't got any other payments from you i mean if you if if you.\\nStill wants to dispute that the only way to do so is uh to obtain whats called a running banks taping.\\nFrom your bank account uh that we would have taken a payment from that you claim we took send it into account.\\nFor review if a payment was made and it was last they'd be the west.\\nTo find it after verify the information and your bank account.\\nOtherwise name there's i mean the truth is into putting for us here that no payment has been made since january twenty ninth.\\nOkay well i don't see how that is but there's no way i can pay that seven hundred and something down in front.\\nIn the bottom did but money until the third.\\nOkay well the thing is is you made a partial payment back on january the twenty ninth the balance for six hundred and thirty.\\nThree uh only four hundred and forty four of us collected leaving one eighty nine is pending balance.\\nWhich at bill uh.\\nBecause you've already made a partial payment a payment in full for seven hundred and eighteen will be required no later than the twenty second of this month otherwise the policy will cancel.\\nOkay and the twenty second was calling me the twelfth.\\nThe twelfth is your initial due date and came do early because again the ballots uh but you have until the twenty second i thought that the twenty second would be the absolute last day for you to make your payment to avoid cancellation.\\nPretty tall been the ah panic would do.\\nThe ford widely when your payment is due but again later partial payment and you left uh dallas.\\nOver it cause your next bill to be do or near.\\nHow'd you pay the full six hundred and thirty three back on the twenty ninth of january.\\nThen this bill would have been for five hundred and twenty nine and they would not have been due until march the fourth.\\nOkay so you're saying that a l hanging a hundred and eighteen holes seven hundred and eighteen dollars by the twenty second just before midnight.\\nOkay i got the confirmation number i'm gonna check my records and seeing the can i don't see how that happened i know i made a partial payment done it wasn't project from january.\\nSo i don't know i don't know what happened but i got the confirmation and i'm going to get the information from my bank and see she was on your body and or is it.\\nOh my mind.\\nOk if you do obtain that running bank statement and you want to send it in for a dispute or i can give you the fax number send it into if you'd like.\\nOh go hold on.\\nHello hello.\\nFax number will be six one four four.\\nFive six to nine four eight.\\nYou include their policy number on a cover sheet that are that way an an a brief statement as to what you're looking to have done by accounting.\\nAlright what you said.\\nOne nine four five six to nine four eight.\\nYou know six one four four or five yes to nine four it yeah

hundred and what four hundred and forty four.\\nOkay so that was for february that lesson generally mom on january twenty nine.\\nSomething wrong.\\nSomething's wrong because that's not right because i i made my painted and made my opinion in uh in january.\\nSo when i made that that'd been from february.\\nHow much would you say it was for.\\nFor calling today how party for four hundred and forty four.\\nSorry oh forty far or forty four.\\nAnd what was the visa card what was the last four numbers.\\nI have a lottery here was we'd a visa card the board i dont have the last four.\\nI have the saudis say should number if you want.\\nTo yeah because that's not right okay i i wake break came at every month or watch because i don't get the money until.\\nFederal get the money until the around the the um third of the month.\\nT i you'd ready to type and your authorization number torn.\\nWhat what.\\nSorry about what is it there oh nine.\\nHold on can't not right and.\\nWe're all along.\\nSports tony for three straight to.\\nWell we call.\\nYes um.\\nOkay there isn't any way i'm going to be able to make that payment because i don't have the money i wont have it in to.\\nThe third that's when i make my payment um i needed to call back and talk to you and ship or visor.\\nCannot speak to one right now um the applicants hold okay mhm.\\nDid pretty need minimum factor manager with safe auto insurance am i speaking to barbara wilson yes elements wilson okay so the rip told me what's going on uh.\\nSo she says that you claim to have made a payment in uh this month ah we don't have a record of it the last time and you made was on the twenty ninth of january.\\nYeah but i paid my i paid every month because i don't get the money until the third of the month to pay.\\nCause i had to talk to them to other people.\\nInteresting well i mean we got to hearing from you january fifth and then another payment january the twenty ninth.\\nThe twenty ninth which was about thirteen days they're fourteen days ago we haven't got any other payments from you i mean if you if if you.\\nStill wants to dispute that the only way to do so is uh to obtain whats called a running banks taping.\\nFrom your bank account uh that we would have taken a payment from that you claim we took send it into account.\\nFor review if a payment was made and it was last they'd be the west.\\nTo find it after verify the information and your bank account.\\nOtherwise name there's i mean the truth is into putting for us here that no payment has been made since january twenty ninth.\\nOkay well i don't see how that is but there's no way i can pay that seven hundred and something down in front.\\nIn the bottom did but money until the third.\\nOkay well the thing is is you made a partial payment back on january the twenty ninth the balance for six hundred and thirty.\\nThree uh only four hundred and forty four of us collected leaving one eighty nine is pending balance.\\nWhich at bill uh.\\nBecause you've already made a partial payment a payment in full for seven hundred and eighteen will be required no later than the twenty second of this month otherwise the policy will cancel.\\nOkay and the twenty second was calling me the twelfth.\\nThe twelfth is your initial due date and came do early because again the ballots uh but you have until the twenty second i thought that the twenty second would be the absolute last day for you to make your payment to avoid cancellation.\\nPretty tall been the ah panic would do.\\nThe ford widely when your payment is due but again later partial payment and you left uh dallas.\\nOver it cause your next bill to be do or near.\\nHow'd you pay the full six hundred and thirty three back on the twenty ninth of january.\\nThen this bill would have been for five hundred and twenty nine and they would not have been due until march the fourth.\\nOkay so you're saying that a l hanging a hundred and eighteen holes seven hundred and eighteen dollars by the twenty second just before midnight.\\nOkay i got the confirmation number i'm gonna check my records and seeing the can i don't see how that happened i know i made a partial payment done it wasn't project from january.\\nSo i don't know i don't know what happened but i got the confirmation and i'm going to get the information from my bank and see she was on your body and or is it.\\nOh my mind.\\nOk if you do obtain that running bank statement and you want to send it in for a dispute or i can give you the fax number send it into if you'd like.\\nOh go hold on.\\nHello hello.\\nFax number will be six one four four.\\nFive six to nine four eight.\\nYou include their policy number on a cover sheet that are that way an an a brief statement as to what you're looking to have done by accounting.\\nAlright what you said.\\nOne nine four five six to nine four eight.\\nYou know six one four four or five yes to nine four it yeah
